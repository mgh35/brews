AWS Amplify framework?

- Promises very quick setup of basic utilities (eg auth, DB, API to DB).
- Prefering to keep with Terraform (for now at least) to make sure it's repeatable.

Terraform state shouldn't live on my local

Still internally debating Amplify vs Terraform

- [This](https://medium.com/@mim3dot/aws-amplify-pros-and-cons-bf77a98da5db) seems to
  align with what I was thinking
- Will persevere with current setup

Internally debating the storage choice

- DynamoDB designed for scale seems to make evolution more difficult
- Cost-wise, at my scale of 1 DynamoDB is basically free vs a non-trivial amount for an
  RDBMS (even a managed instance)
- No reason I have to do DynamoDB as recommended for scale
  - Eg multiple tables will be just fine at my scale of 1
- Naive DynamoDB setup it will be for the moment

I'm now at the point I need a dev environment

- Looks like I can spin up a local DynamoDB in Docker
- React already easy to run in dev
- How do I manage dev config?

Starting to wonder the best way to manage state

- Questions:
  - What happens to local edit if no connection?
  - If two sessions, do they see each other's edits?
- Key Use Cases:
  - Record a new brew
  - Analytics on previous brews
- Design Considerations:
  - Consistency between two contemporaneous sessions not required
  - If connection lost, don't want to lose data entered

Sorting out the split between environments is eating way too much time debating over
nothing:

- How to avoid leaking environment config into other environments?
- How to make sure environments are distinct?
- How will auth work?
- Local or cloud dynamodb?

Plan of attack to just get this done:

1. Abstract all config into a new config.js. Get config.js from .env.{ENV} files.
2. Get local dynamodb running and make sure it connects.
3. Refactor terraform into modules. Make instances for each env. Test will just use a
   Cognito UserPool for the moment.

# 2020-08-03

Massive round-about trying to sort out local DynamoDB. Two things:

1. The credentials can be anything, but have to be present and each set of credentials
   is like a separate sandbox. So if you, eg, create a table with one set of credentials
   you will only be able to see it when using those same credentials.
2. It doesn't add the CORS header to errors. So on an error you will actually see a
   CORS error and not the real error. (This even though CORS is fine on a successful call.)

Finding it difficult to find a standard run configuration for VS Code. Getting all sorts
of setups from different people. This works for me:

```json
{
  "type": "node",
  "request": "launch",
  "name": "Jest Tests",
  "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}/brews/node_modules/.bin/react-scripts",
  "args": ["test", "--runInBand"],
  "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/brews",
  "env": {
    "CI": "true"
  }
}
```

Particularly:

- Need to run `react-scripts`. Doesn't seem to pick up the config in `package.json`?
- Need to set `cwd` since I have the frontend code in a subfolder.
- Need to set `CI` = `true` to avoid tests starting in watch mode.

I want to incorporate Redux, external to whether it's appropriate for the needs of this
particular project (notably, my job uses Redux so I want to learn more about it). At the
same time, I want to take the opportunity to restart the front-end code from scratch
given there's nothing substantive there yet here and I have a better sense how things
should look.

As to whether it's worthwhile having Redux, I've come across different points of view:

1. Redux is a confusing extra framework that's unneeded.
2. Redux is a useful tool as the app grows and managing state in React become
   cumbersome.
3. Redux is to data what React is to the DOM, and they belong together as part of a
   functional app.

The Redux docs seem to argue along the lines of (2), but I found the most convincing
arguments in (3). (I recall one particularly articulate interview that I now can't seem
to find.) The idea being that React is a framework to allow for a stateless and event-
driven view. Redux does the same for state. So if you want to go event-driven, you
really want the two together. And this is regardless of the size of the app.

```sh
npx create-react-app frontend --typescript
cd frontend
npm install --save redux react-redux @types/redux @types/react-redux
```

And first thing after getting React & Redux set up, the question "Now how do I make my
API calls?" hits another wall.

Without extra frameworks, the option would be more
callbacks under the connected components. This seems to break the modularity sought in
the first place. And a quick Google suggests that the duo React + Redux is actually
really a trio React + Redux + API Middleware.

As I currently understand it, I think the end-to-end data flow is supposed to look like:

```text
-------------------------------------------------------------------
                       |                        |
          API          |       ---DOM <---      |       Pure
                       |      |           |     |
------------------------------|-----------|------------------------
                       |      |           V     |
         Redux         |      |      -> STATE   |       Pure
                       |      |    /       ^    |
------------------------------|---/--------|-----------------------
                       |      v  /         |    |
 Redux API Middleware  |     ACTION <--> ACTION |      Impure
                       |     ^ ^ ^              |
-----------------------------|-|-|---------------------------------
                       |     v v v              |
          API          |    ENDPOINTS           |    Way Impure
                       |                        |
-------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The key point of the API Middleware is as a place where the sequenced flow talking to
external endpoints can happen, and still have access to the Store's dispatch to
be able to reinject results to Redux. (This as compared with the connected components
being the only place with a connection to the Store.)

An additional point is that the separation of concerns for APIs might be different to
that for components. For example, there might be a global logged-in user. API queries
will need the users credentials. But components making use of state queries from the API
need not otherwise be connected with the user state.

The key choices available on the Redux API middleware side:

- redux-thunk: Callback-style flow control.
- redux-sagas: Async-style flow control.
- redux-observable: Reactive programming-style flow control. (Uses RxJS.)

Very keen to learn more about RxJS, but something for the future. Will stick with
redux-sagas here just to avoid yet another framework to learn.

For UI components, reaching to `react-bootstrap` mainly out of familiarity. A quick
search comes up with tons of different options and no clear way to decide. But
`react-bootstrap` has lots of starts and I am roughly familiar. Going with that.

Looking at navigation, hitting yet another stumbling block. Looks like
`react-router-dom` is the thing. Still waiting for the point when all of this growing
infra pays off...

# 2020-09-20

As has become the theme, the next change requires yet another rethink. This time, the
issue is around how to manage the submission of a new Brew. On pressing Add Brew, I want
to:

- Submit an API call to add a Brew
- Mark the form as un-editable (but not clear it), with a spinner or something
- When the API call comes back:
  - If success, clear out the form
  - If failure, show an error message but leave the form as is

It feels like the problem is:

- My form is now off Redux (per the various discussion on redux-forms)
- But my API call is currently mediated through redux(-saga)
- So on API callback:
  - The Store doesn't have state needed to process the form change
  - The Component doesn't have a hook to the callback

which would suggest that the way forward is either:

1. Move the form state back to Redux
2. Bring the API call into the Component (so the components is completely off Redux)

The main reason for using Redux was for educational purposes. So hard to justify going
further down that path now that it's really starting to be an impediment. I think at
this junction, then, I call the Redux experiment over and go with (2). To be decided
whether better to then refactor Redux out at one go or to remove components as the need
arises. Will see how this first change goes.

The testing strategy needs a rethink. I'm spending significant time trying to figure out
how to write tests for features with very little value in the tests. (Though, again,
there has been plenty of pedagogic value in figuring out what testing is possible.) Key
examples:

- BrewList: As a connective component, it's intended to be a stateless, declarative
  component. I am not convinced that a test of the resulting HTML is going to prove of
  much value.
- brewList/reducers: Without anything complex in the reducer, testing it is just an
  exercise in repeating the same requirement a second time.

My suspicion is that:

- It's valuable to have the unit tests up and running.
  - If there is ever some complex logic that could benefit from testing there will
    already be the required structure to introduce it.
  - I'm not sure how to keep that without writing useless tests. Maybe it's actually
    best to just wait until a test is actually wanted.
- It would be valuable to have some integration tests to record use-cases.

Using the app now for a week or so, it's readily apparent that it's worse than the
spreadsheet I was using previously. Not surprising since this exercise has primarily
focussed on learning about React & Redux, rather than building the product. But I feel
like that has run it's course and I want to build the product that initially started
this.

The outcomes that need to be addressed:

- The input should be easy.
- It should be quick to iterate on ideas around new inputs (including new types of
  inputs).
- There should be measures of qualitative measures.

The experience starting to work through issues evidences that the current stack fails on
all counts. Key problems:

- Testing. The current state of the tests is a hindrance to speed and hasn't yet shown
  to add any value. (A rough subjective accounting makes me think most of the time
  spent has been building tests.)
- Dispersed structures. Changes propagate widely through the system despite just being
  an input form.
- Rigid models. Because of the infrastructure around the model, changes to the model
  have already become difficult.

and what seemed to be working well:

- React. The dynamic components seemed to be exactly what was wanted.
- Typing. So nice to have in the JS sphere. That also seems to be part of what makes the
  testing much less relevant.

So, following the best front-end dev I know, I'm going to "refactor." Scrapping the lot
and starting again given what I've learnt so far. This time, focus is on delivering a
useful product.

The intent with the new version is to follow the guiding principles:

- The app is just there to ease recording of data.
- The app should be very quick to change.
- The data model needs to be easy to evolve (without losing previous data).

# 2010-10-11

Already stuck with indecision in the refactor. Rediscovered [5] from the Zen of Python:

```
Flat is better than nested.
```

Must `import this` more often.
