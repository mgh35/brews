AWS Amplify framework?
- Promises very quick setup of basic utilities (eg auth, DB, API to DB).
- Prefering to keep with Terraform (for now at least) to make sure it's repeatable.

Terraform state shouldn't live on my local

Still internally debating Amplify vs Terraform 
- [This](https://medium.com/@mim3dot/aws-amplify-pros-and-cons-bf77a98da5db) seems to
    align with what I was thinking 
- Will persevere with current setup
